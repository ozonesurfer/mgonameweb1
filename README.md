This is a sample Go (golang) website/server using MongoDB and the Go web framework. You will need:

<b>Go: http://golang.org/doc/install</b>
<b>MongoDB: http://www.mongodb.org/downloads</b>
<b>mgo: Issue on the command line:

<i>go get labix.org/v2/mgo</i></b>

You might need the "bzr" command from <b>http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/</b> in order to install mgo. Add the path to "bzr" ("bzr.exe" in Windows) in your search path.

In order to build the executable, first add the full path of this repository to the GOPATH environment variable. Then issue the <i>go build</i> command. This will create "mgonameweb1" (mgonameweb1.exe in Windows). 

View the website at <i>localhost:8080</i>
